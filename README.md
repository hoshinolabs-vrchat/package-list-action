# ðŸ¤– VPM Package Automation

This repo hosts a [Nuke](https://nuke.build/) project to help build, release and host [VPM packages](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/vpm/packages).

Check out the [VPM Package Template repo](https://github.com/ikuko/template-package) for info on how to use it.

---
For developers working on the actual automation code contained herein, you can test things locally by checking out the above template-package repo into a sibling folder of this one. If that structure doesn't work for you, check it out wherever you want and override the `LocalTestPackagesPath` parameter.
